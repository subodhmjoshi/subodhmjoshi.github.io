Welcome to my website! <br />
</p>
<p>I am a researcher specializing in scientific computing, currently working as an AI Researcher (SciML) at Shell. 
Previously, I was a C. V. Raman Postdoctoral Fellow at <a href="http://cds.iisc.ac.in/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>CDS, IISc Bangalore</a>, 
a postdoctoral researcher at IMB (University of Bordeaux), and the INRIA Bordeaux Sud-Ouest research center with the 
<a href="https://team.inria.fr/cardamom/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>CARDAMOM</a> team in France. 
Before that, I worked as a Project Research Scientist at <a href="https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>ME, IIT Bombay</a>.
I completed my Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay under the supervision of 
<a href="https://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/home/people/faculty/avijit" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. Avijit Chatterjee</a>.
</p>
<p>My research focuses on developing solution strategies for conservation and balance laws, along with simulating engineering and natural systems. 
Currently, I am working on physics-informed machine learning, Physics-AI hybrid modeling, data-driven fluid dynamics, and simulation-based Digital Twins. 
My work has applications in neural surrogates for industrial systems, AI-driven smart proxies for subsurface reservoirs, 
AI-assisted inverse modeling for carbonate composition discovery, 
Tsunami simulation, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and highway traffic modeling. 
I'm also interested in high-performance computing, higher-order accurate methods for CFD, and uncertainty quantification.
</p>
<p>Outside of research, I enjoy reading, photography, trekking, and pencil sketching.
</p>
<p>Feel free to take a look at my publications and projects. Lastly, you may find something interesting in the 
links section. Have a good day!
