Welcome to my website! <br />
</p>
<p>I am a researcher working in the general area of scientific computing. 
I am currently working as a postdoc fellow at the department of 
Computational and Data Sciences (<a href="http://cds.iisc.ac.in/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>CDS</a>), Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. 
Prior to this, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at IMB (university of Bordeaux) and INRIA Bordeaux Sud-Ouest 
research center (team <a href="https://team.inria.fr/cardamom/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>CARDAMOM</a>) in France and before that 
as a Project Research Scientist at <a href="https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>ME, IIT Bombay</a>.
I obtained my Ph.D. from the department of Aerospace Engineering at
the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay
under the guidance of <a href="https://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/home/people/faculty/avijit" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. Avijit Chatterjee</a>. 
</p>
<p>I am particularly interested in different
solution strategies for conservation laws. 
My ongoing research focuses on physics-informed Machine Learning, data-driven fluid dynamics and
simulation based Digital Twins. 
Some of the application areas of my research include shallow water dynamics, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Gasdynamics, 
Computational Aeroacoustics (CAA) and highway traffic modeling. In addition to this, my research interests include
high performance computing, higher-order accurate methods for CFD and uncertainty quantification. 
Apart from research, I enjoy reading, photography, trekking and pencil sketching. 
</p>
<p>Feel free to take a look at my publications and projects. Lastly, you may find something interesting in the 
links section. Have a good day!
